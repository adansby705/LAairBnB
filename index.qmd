This is a Quarto website.

## Project Overview

This site summarizes our analysis of Airbnb listings in Los Angeles.  
We document our data sources, cleaning, enrichment (price per person, amenities, annual revenue, stay type), and key results.

## Data and Methods

- **Data source:** LA Airbnb listings scraped from Airbnb dtaset (LA_Airbnb_ALL.csv)
- **Raw format:** CSV file with one row per listing and columns for price, location, reviews, etc.
- **Cleaning & enrichment:**
  - Converted nightly price from strings to numeric.
  - Created price per person = price / accommodates.
  - Parsed amenities into a list, then flagged WiFi, kitchen, free parking, pool, air conditioning.
  - Used estimated occupancy to compute annual revenue.
  - Categorized listings by stay type (short / medium / long) using minimum nights.
- **Tools:** Python, pandas, plotly, ipywidgets, Quarto.
