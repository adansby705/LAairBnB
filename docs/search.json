    "text": "LA Airbnb Visualizations\nThis page shows several key visualizations from our analysis and highlights the enriched variables we created: price per person, amenity flags, annual revenue, stay type, and review score.\n\n\n\nCode\n### Visualization: Price Distribution \nimport plotly.express as px\n# Filter price range for visualization\nprice_cap = 500\ndf_price_plot = df[df['price_num'].between(0, price_cap)]\n\nfig_price_dist = px.histogram(\n    df_price_plot,\n    x='price_num',\n    nbins=50,\n    title='Distribution of Nightly Price (0–$500)',\n    labels={'price_num': 'Nightly price (USD)'}\n)\nfig_price_dist.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\nNightly Price Distribution (0–$500) The distribution of nightly prices in Los Angeles is right-skewed, with most listings clustered between $80 and $250 per night. This indicates that while LA does have luxury, high-priced properties, they represent a small portion of the market. The majority of Airbnb listings fall into a moderate and affordable price range.\n\n\n\nCode\n# if we want to show price per person \nprice_pp_cap = 250\ndf_pp_plot = df[df['price_per_person'].between(0, price_pp_cap)]\n\nfig_price_pp = px.histogram(\n    df_pp_plot,\n    x='price_per_person',\n    nbins=50,\n    title='Distribution of Nightly Price per Person',\n    labels={'price_per_person': 'Price per person (USD)'}\n)\nfig_price_pp.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\nPrice Per Person Distribution When adjusting for the number of guests accommodated, price-per-person becomes much more concentrated, typically between $20 and $80 per person. This suggests that many higher-priced listings actually offer good value when shared by multiple guests. The distribution also highlights affordability differences between solo\n\n\n\nCode\n### Visualization: Room type vs price \ndf_room_plot = df[df['price_num'].between(0, price_cap)]\n\nfig_room_price = px.box(\n    df_room_plot,\n    x='room_type',\n    y='price_num',\n    title='Price by Room Type (0–$500)',\n    labels={'room_type': 'Room type', 'price_num': 'Nightly price (USD)'}\n)\nfig_room_price.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\nBox Plot — Price by Room Type Entire homes/apartments consistently have the highest price range, with a noticeably larger spread and more extreme high-end listings. Private rooms tend to be moderately priced with lower variability, while shared rooms remain the most budget-friendly and tightly clustered. This pattern reflects the premium placed on privacy and full-property access.\n\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\nTop 15 Most Expensive Neighborhoods (Bar Chart) The most expensive neighborhoods show dramatically higher average prices, reflecting areas with luxury properties or tourist-driven demand. These neighborhoods cluster around premium coastal or central LA zones. The significant price differences indicate how strongly location influences listing value.\n\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Clean price column if not already done\ndf['price_num'] = pd.to_numeric(\n    df['price'].str.replace(r'[\\$,]', '', regex=True),\n    errors='coerce'\n)\n\n# Filter rows with valid ratings + prices\ndf_reviews = df[\n    df['review_scores_rating'].notna() &\n    df['price_num'].notna()\n].copy()\n\n# ----- Choose fixed filter values -----\nmin_rating = 4.0     # minimum acceptable review score\nmax_price = 500      # maximum price to show\n# --------------------------------------\n\n# Apply the filters\nfiltered = df_reviews[\n    (df_reviews['review_scores_rating'] &gt;= min_rating) &\n    (df_reviews['price_num'] &lt;= max_price)\n]\n\n# Build title\ntitle = f\"Price vs Review Score (Rating ≥ {min_rating}, Price ≤ ${max_price})\"\n\n# Create scatter plot\nfig = px.scatter(\n    filtered,\n    x=\"review_scores_rating\",\n    y=\"price_num\",\n    color=\"room_type\",\n    opacity=0.6,\n    title=title,\n    labels={\n        \"review_scores_rating\": \"Review Score Rating\",\n        \"price_num\": \"Nightly Price (USD)\",\n        \"room_type\": \"Room Type\"\n    }\n)\n\nfig.update_layout(height=500)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nPrice vs. Review Score (Static Visualization): This scatter plot explores whether higher guest review scores are associated with higher nightly prices.\nListings are filtered to include only properties with strong ratings (4.0 or above) and prices under $500 per night.\nEach point represents an Airbnb listing, colored by room type.\nThe chart shows that while higher-rated listings span a wide range of prices, extremely low-rated listings tend to cluster at cheaper price points, suggesting that quality and guest satisfaction can influence pricing but are not the only determining factors."
